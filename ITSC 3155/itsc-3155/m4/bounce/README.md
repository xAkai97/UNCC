# Bonus Activity: Bouncing Shapes

## Introduction

In this activity, you will be finishing the HTML and CSS for a bouncing shapes animation. The main animation is already written for you, but your job is to implement a few new CSS classes and HTML elements to tie everything together. To complete this activity, you will need to carefully study the code already written for you. Most of the missing pieces are nearly identical to existing code, but to create the shapes that you want, you will need to add some extra effects.

## Task 1: Finish the HTML

- Open the `index.html` file in this folder.
- Complete `TODO 1` by linking the `style.css` file to the `index.html` file.
- Complete `TODO 2` by adding a `div` element for each shape you will be animating (square, triangle, and hexagon).
  - **Note**: You will need to add a `class` attribute to each `div` element with the value `shape`.

## Task 2: Finish the CSS

- Open the `style.css` file in this folder.
- Complete `TODO 3` by creating a classes for each shape.
  - **TIP:** There are many ways to creat the triangle and hexagon shapes, but here are a few CSS properties that may help in the process:
    - [border-radius](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/border-radius)
    - [transform](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform)
    - [transform-origin](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/transform-origin)
    - [clip-path](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/CSS/clip-path)
