# Project 1: Software Requirements Specification Document

This serves as a template for each projects' Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. When filling this out, you will be required to create user stories, use cases, requirements, and a glossary of terms relevant to your project. Each group member must contribute to every section, so it is crucial that your group's GitHub repository shows a commit history that reflects the work of each group member. It is highly recommended that you create separate branches for each member, but since this is one single document, you will need to manually merge the branches together. It is also advisable to have multiple working versions of this document (named separately) so that one person can compile the final SRS document from the multiple working versions. Ultimately, how you go about managing this is up to you, but consistent formatting, clear commit messages, and a thorough commit history with contributions from each group member are required.

Fill the document out following the guidelines listed in each section. Maintain [proper Markdown syntax](https://www.markdownguide.org/basic-syntax/).

## Introduction

In this section, you should give a brief overview of what your project will be. Describe the software system you are building and what problems it solves. You should also give a short description of the stakeholders (users of the system) and what their needs are. There is no set formatting requirement, but you should maintain a consistent structure across future sections. Not all members must contribute to this section.

## KA Introduction:

Our system would be a Soccer Jersey Shop System. An online store for fans of the English Premiere League to buy and personalize their favorite soccer teams jerseys. This would be a comprehensive software solution designed to create a simple viewing and purchasing experience for users. We would optimize and simplify the viewing and customization of Premier League jerseys by integrating multiple modules targeted at simplification. 

Some problems many faces when purchasing these kits online is that when searching for their team, they find a plethora of jerseys, and they are all listed as individual items. An example would be when you search for Chelsea kits, you'll end up being listed 60 items. Another issue is customization. Many won't find shops that will have kits and have you able to put your own name or custom number. Variety and selection is also an issue. We would make sure to have all the Premiere League teams available. User Experience is the biggest issue we found with most stores. Finding what you want is complicated and convoluted. 

Needs for the users of our system is important. Our primary users are soccer fans. They seek a collection of authentic Premier League team jerseys. They also desire customization. There are also collectors looking to buy multiple versions of those jerseys. Sizing for everyone, including younger fans is need that users will require access to.

## Constraints

In this section, you should list any constraints that you have for the project. Each group member must supply at least two constraints. These can be constraints on the project itself, the software system, or the stakeholders. Constraints can be anything that limits the scope of the project. For example, that this project's template code is written using Flask and Python constitutes a constraint on the backend of the project. Constraints can also be things like the required timeline of the project. Be creative.

- **HB 1:** Constraint: Time Constraints. Details: The project has a fixed timeline with specific deadlines and milestones. The team must work within the given time constraints to plan and execute the development, testing, and deployment phases. Proper project management techniques, such as scheduling and task prioritization, need to be implemented to ensure timely delivery of the final product.
- **HB 2:** Constraint: Limited Team Size Description: The project team may have a limited number of members, such as two or three students working on the project. Impact: With a smaller team size, it may be challenging to allocate sufficient resources and effort to cover all aspects of the project, requiring effective task management and coordination.

- **DW 3:** Constraint: Scope constraint. Details: The project's goals, features, and functions, in addition to the tasks required to complete the project affects the outcome of the project, It’s important to define the activities, deliverables and milestones in addition to what won’t be done to set clear guideline. Impact: It can consume time and resources without yielding satisfactory results that could have been used for other meanful tasks. 
- **DW 4:** Constraint: Knowledge Constraints Details: The project team may have not have relevant and necessary knowledge to implement all the requirements. Impact: It may be challenging to make all aspects of the project functional.

- **MH 5:** Constraint: Realistic ideas. Details: The team must ensure that the aspirations for our site are achievable and practical. The requirements should strike a balance between simplicity and providing excellent functionality for the online store's users. Impact: We aim to avoid overly ambitious goals that might consume excessive time and resources without yielding satisfactory results.
- **MH 6:** Constraint: Site creativity. Details: We aim to ensure that our site exhibits creativity and originality, avoiding a plain and uninspiring appearance that may fail to captivate users. Impact: Without unique features and creative elements, our site might appear lackluster, potentially leading to reduced user engagement and interaction.

- **KA 7:** Constraint: Time Management. Details: With all of us being students taking summer courses, there might be issues with time management and finding time to meet to discuss the project. Impact: Depending on how communicative we are, this might be quite challenging. 
- **KA 8:** Constraint: Complicated Ideas. Details: There are lots of ideas that would be very beneficial for the shop, but with how much time we have and our limited knowledge as students, some things might not be able to be done in time. Impact: Not as impactful as long as we understand our restrictions. 

## Use Cases

  - **Postconditions:** A list of the postconditions for the use case. This should be a list of the postconditions for the use case, which are the conditions that must be met after the use case has been executed.
