# Project 4: Testing

## Introduction/Description

Now it is time to test the code you have added. Since there will be a variety of codebase structures across the entire class, the specific requirements for this stage are minimal. But you must, as a group, write tests for each of the implemented functions/features that you added in the previous phase. These tests should be integrated into the existing test suite from the template codebase. You should document these in either the `docs/directories/testing.md` file or with comments in the test files themselves. After this, another group member should review your tests and make sure they are correct and complete. Each group member should create a file in the `testing/reviews` directory similar to the `template.md` file. In this file, document which tests you reviewed, when you reviewed them, and any comments or concerns you have about them. Name the file with your NinerNetID and the word "review". For example, if I reviewed the tests, I would name the file `dgary9_review.md`.

## Continue Developing

Everything in your codebase should be tested by the end of this project, but it is likely that the implementations you had hoped to finish by now still need some work. Test the features you can, and keep coding! This iterative, complicated process is a part of software development. Reach out to the TAs if you're struggling with implementations.

## Submission Details

- On Canvas, submit the following:
  - The URL to your group's GitHub repository, with the latest version of your code pushed to the `main` branch.
